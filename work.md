This is a brief representation of my work
Im interested in compilers and systems. Im also making up my mind to involve myself in pyston or cpython communities.

Detecting Texts in Digitized Images using Support Vector Machines
>	Text detection in images is the first step towards text recognition in images .It can be challenging to isolate or localaize the presence of text in an image due to the complex background, poor lighting low resolution etc., texts occur in.The problem of text localaization is tackled in this report. This report describes few well known recent methods to localize texts besides proposing a new framework that utilizes connected component methods and supervised machine learning methods . Firstly, the image is preproceced , connected components is calculated using Kosa Rajus  strongly connected components over the probabilistic edge graph . Secondly,The region of interests are then prunned based on geometric information.Thirdly,The regions are further prunned using Support vector machine trained on Gabor features .The report discusses reasons for the choice  and  complexity of the algorithm . The data used for evaluation was collected from google images ,ICDAR dataset,GROCR,spam advertisement posters .Experiments show that the proposed method can detect texts with various fonts,size and color,in various cluttered background, with few false positives.

Object tracking using Velocity clustering techniques
>	In this report a robust object tracking technique is proposed using velocity Clustering . A  Lucus Kanade particle filter is used to track the object .The tracker's confidence is determined based on the velocity space using clustering techniques . The final location of the object also takes into account the decsion from an independant detector with updated image templates helping the framework to track the object throug and out of occlusion.The report discusses the clustering algorithm, learning method and the distance metric used in the framework .It also includes results from LK tracker and histogram based trackers for comparison. Though our method was not as much robust as Predator learning algorithm , it was significantly faster and can possibly be used in embedded systems for real-time applications.

## Programming


Voice recorder app
>A recorder app oriented towards helping people improve public speaking . It allows the user to rate his content and improve his score. 
It also includs users to ask others in facebook to rate the content.It was built using python and Tkinter for ubuntu software center.

Lloyd's 15
> A  web app ,with new flavour,  on 15 tile puzzle which was popularized by Lloyd early in the 19th century. It allows users to track their scores ,view leader boards call friends . It runs on Google App Engine.


Karger's minimum Cut
> A simple visulalaization of kargers minimum cut algorithm using d3 javascript.

Chat Bot
> A chat bot which was constructed soon after AI course . it uses 3 chain markov models learnt over a huge corpus on web and 
Implemented from this publication . Backend runs on Google app engine.
