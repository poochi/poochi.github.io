Hey there ! My name is *Gowtham Rangarajan Raman*. Im called as *rang* by most.<br>
I hack into linux kernel, android OS and ARM compilers apart from writing test suites ,refactoring utilities for audio components during my dayjob <a href="http://ittiam.com/en/Index.aspx">here</a> .I can turn nocturnal , at times, to satiate my love for building software .Im simply in love with Python and <a href="http://poochi-recommend.appspot.com/testweb">machine-learning</a> .I explore my creative side by writing apps for the web , mobile and at times Desktops . I love reading reasearch publications,implementing it, and explaining it to fellow engineers . I love to learn by doing and certainly not afraid to jump tracks !

	In search of a perfect problem that fuses machine-learning , creativity , kernel and compilers .

You can always find me working on something , be it developing a game, or a mobile app ,or hacking execs or discussing math/programming problem with folks. I guess its part of the 'exploring' phase.

	I love elegant and terse solutions, generally algorithmic in nature. I strive a lot to imbibe my philosophy (on simplicity and elegance) in my work.

I indulge in playing *football* , cycling and ocassionally reading *tamil* poetry . 
Its easy to be friends with me : *say that you are a* <a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones"> *GAME OF THRONES* </a>fan

I was strongly inclined towards math and phyics during my high school and during most of my college days .
I had presented a talk at Physics Society of Madras on *"Intuitive understanding of particle motion under Lorentz field"* during my senior secondary years .Me and my friend ,Pradhyumna designed a graphical approach to count the number of solutions to *Inverse Diophantine equations* just after college .I've taken quiet a number of coursera courses on programming.

  "She danced with rapture, with passion, intoxicated by pleasure, forgetting all in the triumph of her beauty, in the glory of her success, in a sort of cloud of happiness comprised of all this homage, admiration, these awakened desires and of that sense of triumph which is so sweet to woman's heart."

save me why indeed should I seek other gods? And should you
decide not to save me, who else will dare intercede?"
