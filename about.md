Hey there ! My name is *Gowtham Rangarajan Raman*. Im also called as *rang* among friends and *poochi* when im online .<br>
I hack into linux kernel, android OS and ARM compilers apart from writing test suites ,refactoring utilities for audio components during my dayjob <a href="http://ittiam.com/en/Index.aspx">here</a> .I can turn nocturnal , at times, to satiate my passion for building software .Im simply in love with Python and <a href="http://poochi-recommend.appspot.com/testweb">machine-learning</a> .I try explore my creative side by writing apps for the web , mobile and at times Desktops . I enjoy reading research publications,implementing them, and explaining it to other folks . I learn by doing and am certainly not afraid to jump tracks ! 

## Orignal Work
In chronological order

Detecting Texts in Digitized Images using Support Vector Machines
>	In this report a robust text detection technique is proposed using Support Vector Machine techniques. The Image is modelled as gradient using a preprocessing techniques to remove non-text regions with certainity. which are passed through an SVM to assert the presence of text in the region . The report also provides a comparison between ada boost HOGs  and SVM  learners for this task. It was concluded that SVM technique was better by good marigins .The data used for the analysis was collected from google images ,IDCAR dataset,GROCR .

This is an unpublished technical report of my Bachelor's project[Feb 2012]

Object tracking using Velocity clustering techniques
>	In this report a robust object tracking technique is proposed using velocity Clustering . A  Lucus Kanade particle filter is used to track the object .The tracker's confidence is determined based on the velocity space using clustering techniques . The final location of the object also takes into account the decsion from an independant detector with updated image templates helping the framework to track the object throug and out of occlusion.
The report discusses the clustering method, learning method and the distance metric used in the framework .It also includes results from LK tracker and histogram based trackers for comparison. Though our method was not as much robust as Predator learning algorithm , it was significantly faster and can possibly be used in embedded systems for real-time applications.

This is a *Published* work in International Conference on Bio-Medical Assited Technologies [April-Dec 2010]


Please check my projects page for the programming projects that i've involved myself in.

## Technical Talks
	Celt Encoder
>	Working of Encoders and Celt encoders specifically. Analysing Algorithmic complexity and proposing alternative
algorithms and techniques 

*Delivered at Ittiam Systems*


>	In search of a perfect problem that fuses machine-learning , creativity , kernel and compilers .


You can always find me working on something , be it developing a game, or a mobile app ,or hacking execs or discussing math/programming problem with folks. I guess its part of the 'exploring' phase for a newbie . 


>	I love elegant and terse solutions, generally algorithmic in nature. I strive a lot to imbibe my philosophy (on simplicity and elegance) in my work.

## Publications

I indulge in playing *football* , cycling and ocassionally reading *tamil* and *sanskrit* poetry . 
Its easy to be friends with me : *say that you are a* <a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones"> *GAME OF THRONES* </a>fan

  Forgive me for indulging ,read ahead only if you are curious enough !

I was strongly inclined towards math and phyics during my high school and during most of my college days .
I had presented a talk at Physics Society of Madras on *"Intuitive understanding of particle motion under Lorentz field"* during my senior secondary years .Me and my friend ,Pradhyumna, designed a graphical approach to count the number of solutions to *Inverse Diophantine equations* just after college . I've taken quiet a number of coursera courses on programming.

* Im known as *poochi* whenever im online ,wherever im online
* I did my undergrad in Electronics and Communication Engineering at <a href="http://www.nitt.edu">NIT Trichy </a> .
* Im addicted to simplicity and elegance in Math ,Physics ,Programming and perhaps in life.
* Im baffled by our Economic structure , with awe ,always wondering What prevents it from collapsing ? 
* An admirer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghuram_Rajan">*Raghuram Rajan* </a> and, my bestfriend,*Chitra*
* I like reading ,philosophical,short stories by *Guy-De-Maupassant* (*The Necklace* is my favourite) .
* I played cricket for my district as a off-break spin bowler and Right-hand batsman.
