Hey there ! My name is *Gowtham Rangarajan Raman*. I'm also called as *rang* among friends and *poochi* when im online. <br>
I hack into linux kernel, android OS and ARM compilers apart from writing test suites, refactoring utilities for audio components during my dayjob <a href="http://ittiam.com/en/Index.aspx">here</a>. I can turn nocturnal, at times, to satiate my passion for building software. I explore my creative side by writing apps for the web, mobile and at times Desktops. I enjoy reading research publications,implementing them and explaining it to other folks. I learn by doing and am certainly not afraid to jump tracks! 

You can always find me working on something,  be it developing a game, or a mobile app, or hacking execs or discussing math/programming problem with folks. I guess its part of the 'exploring' phase for a newbie. 


>	I love elegant and terse solutions generally algorithmic in nature. I strive a lot to imbibe my philosophy (on simplicity and elegance) in my work.

I indulge in playing *football*, cycling and ocassionally reading *tamil* and *sanskrit* poetry. 
Its easy to be friends with me : *say that you are a* <a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones"> *GAME OF THRONES* </a>fan

I was strongly inclined towards math and phyics during my high school and during most of my college days. 
I had presented a talk at Physics Society of Madras on *"Intuitive understanding of particle motion under Lorentz field"* during my senior secondary years. Me and my friend, Pradhyumna, designed a graphical approach to count the number of solutions to *Inverse Diophantine equations* just after college. I've taken quiet a number of coursera courses on programming.

  "She danced with rapture, with passion, intoxicated by pleasure, forgetting all in the triumph of her beauty, in the glory of her success, in a sort of cloud of happiness comprised of all this homage, admiration, these awakened desires and of that sense of triumph which is so sweet to woman's heart."

save me why indeed should I seek others? And should you
