Hey there ! My name is *Gowtham Rangarajan Raman*. Im affectionately called as *rang*.<br>
I hack into linux kernel, android OS and recently ARM compilers during my dayjob <a href="http://www.ittiam.com">here</a> .
Im simply in love with Python and <a href="http://poochi-recommend.appspot.com/testweb">machine-learning</a> .
I explore my creative side by writing apps for the web , mobile and at times Desktops . I love reading reasearch publications,implementing it, and explaining it to fellow engineers . I love to learn by doing and certainly not afraid to jump tracks !

You can always find me working on something , be it developing a game, or a mobile app ,or hacking execs or discussing math/programming problem with folks. I guess its part of the 'exploring' phase

	I love elegant and terse solutions, generally algorithmic in nature. I do strive a lot to imbibe my philosophy (on simplicity and elegance) in my work.

I indulge in playing *football* , cycling and ocassionally reading *tamil* poetry . 
Its easy to be friends with me : *say that you are a* <a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones"> *GAME OF THRONES* </a>fan

I was strongly inclined towards math and phyics during my high school and during most of my college days .
I had presented an talk at Physics Society of Madras on *"Intuitive understanding of particle motion under Lorentz field"* during my senior secondary years .Me and my friend ,Pradhyumna designed a graphical approach to count the number of solutions to *Inverse Diophantine equations* just after college.I've taken quiet a number of coursera courses on programming.

* Im known as *poochi* when im online ,wherever im online
* I did my undergrad in ECE at <a href="http://www.nitt.edu">NIT Trichy </a> .
* Im addicted to simplicity and elegance in Math ,Physics ,Programming and perhaps in life.
* Im baffled by our Economic structure and always wondered why wouldnt it collapse ? 
* An admirer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghuram_Rajan">*Raghuram Rajan* </a> and, my bestfriend,*Chitra*
* I used to read short stories by *Guy-De-Maupassant* (*The Necklace* is my favourite) and *Agatha Chiristie*

Thanks for reading!
