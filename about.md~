Hey there ! My name is *Gowtham Rangarajan Raman*. Im also called as *rang* .<br>
I hack into linux kernel, android OS and ARM compilers apart from writing test suites ,refactoring utilities for audio components during my dayjob <a href="http://ittiam.com/en/Index.aspx">here</a> .I can turn nocturnal , at times, to satiate my passion for building software .Im simply in love with Python and <a href="http://poochi-recommend.appspot.com/testweb">machine-learning</a> .I try explore my creative side by writing apps for the web , mobile and at times Desktops . I enjoy reading research publications,implementing them, and explaining it to other folks . I learn by doing and am certainly not afraid to jump tracks ! 


>	In search of a perfect problem that fuses machine-learning , creativity , kernel and compilers .


You can always find me working on something , be it developing a game, or a mobile app ,or hacking execs or discussing math/programming problem with folks. I guess its part of the 'exploring' phase for a newbie . 


>	I love elegant and terse solutions, generally algorithmic in nature. I strive a lot to imbibe my philosophy (on simplicity and elegance) in my work.



I indulge in playing *football* , cycling and ocassionally reading *tamil* and *sanskrit* poetry . 
Its easy to be friends with me : *say that you are a* <a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones"> *GAME OF THRONES* </a>fan

I was strongly inclined towards math and phyics during my high school and during most of my college days .
I had presented a talk at Physics Society of Madras on *"Intuitive understanding of particle motion under Lorentz field"* during my senior secondary years .Me and my friend ,Pradhyumna, designed a graphical approach to count the number of solutions to *Inverse Diophantine equations* just after college . I've taken quiet a number of coursera courses on programming.
