Hey there ! My name is Gowtham Rangarajan R. 
I hack into linux kernel, android OS and recently ARM compilers during my dayjob <a href="www.ittiam.com">here</a> .
Im simply in love with Python and <a href="www.poochi-recommed.appspo.com/testweb">machine-learning</a> .
I explore my creative side by writing apps for the web , mobile and at times Desktops . I love reading reasearch publications and explaining it to fellow engineers . I love to learn by doing and certainly not afraid to jump tracks !

You can always find me working on something , be it developing a game, or an app ,or hacking execs or discussing math/programming with folks.

	I love elegant and terse solutions, generally algorithmic in nature. I do strive a lot to imbibe my philosophy (on simplicity and elegance) in my work.

I indulge in playing *football* , cycling and reading *tamil* poetry . 
Its easy to be friends with me : *say that you are a* <a href="www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones"> *GAME OF THRONES fan* </a>

I was strongly inclined towards math and phyics during my high school and during most of my college days .
Me and my friend ,Pradhyumna designed a graphical approach to count the number of solutions to inverse diophantine equations .
